    "about": "This ruleset consists of numerous rules that are considered standard by NCC Group. The rules enabled range from violations of well-known security best practices to gaps resulting from less-known security implications of provider-specific mechanisms. Additional rules exist, some of them requiring extra-parameters to be configured, and some of them being applicable to a limited number of users.",
