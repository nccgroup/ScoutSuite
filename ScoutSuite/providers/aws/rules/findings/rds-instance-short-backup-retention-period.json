    "rationale": "The backup retention period is a period of time between 0 and 35 days for which you can perform a point-in-time restore. Setting the backup retention period to 0 disables automated backups.<br><br>It is recommended that the retention period is set to at least 30 days. Having a short retention period will impact how far back in time the database can be restored to, and may affect integrity and availability of data.",
