  "rationale": "There could be scenarios where users accidently run delete/purge commands on key vault or attacker/malicious user does it deliberately to cause disruption. Deleting or purging a key vault leads to immediate data loss as keys encrypting data and secrets/certificates allowing access/services will become non-accessible.",
  "remediation": "From Azure CLI: <br> <samp>az resource update --id /subscriptions/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault /vaults/<keyVaultName> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true</samp></br>",
