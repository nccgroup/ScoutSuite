    "description": "Blob Containers Allowing Public Access",
    "rationale": "Anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature.<br><br>It is recommended not to provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers.",
    "remediation": "First, follow Microsoft documentation and created shared access signature tokens for your blob containers.<br><br>Then, in the Azure console:<ol><li>Go to <samp>Storage Accounts</samp></li> <li>For each storage account, go to <samp>Containers</samp> under <samp>Blob Service</samp></li> <li>For each container, click <samp>Access policy</samp></li> <li>Set <samp>Public access level</samp> to <samp>Private (no anonymous access)</samp></li></ol>",
