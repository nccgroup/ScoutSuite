    "description": "DNSSEC key-signing key uses RSASHA1",
    "rationale": "The algorithm used for key signing should be a recommended one and it should be strong. When enabling DNSSEC for a managed zone, or creating a managed zone with DNSSEC, the user can select the DNSSEC signing algorithms and the denial-of-existence type. Changing the DNSSEC settings is only effective for a managed zone if DNSSEC is not already enabled. If there is a need to change the settings for a managed zone where it has been enabled, turn DNSSEC off and then re-enable it with different settings.",
    "remediation": "From Console:\n<ol>\n    <li>\n\n        1. If it is necessary to change the settings for a managed zone where it has been enabled, NSSEC must be turned\n        off and re-enabled with different settings. To turn off DNSSEC, run the following command:\n        <br>\n        <code>\n            gcloud dns managed-zones update ZONE_NAME --dnssec-state off\n        </code>\n        </br>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        2. To update key-signing for a reported managed DNS Zone, run the following command:\n        <br>\n        <code> gcloud dns managed-zones update ZONE_NAME --dnssec-state on --ksk-algorithm KSK_ALGORITHM\n            --ksk-key-length KSK_KEY_LENGTH --zsk-algorithm ZSK_ALGORITHM --zsk-key-length ZSK_KEY_LENGTH\n            --denial-of-existence DENIAL_OF_EXISTENCE\n        </code>\n        </br>\n    </li>\n\n</ol>",
