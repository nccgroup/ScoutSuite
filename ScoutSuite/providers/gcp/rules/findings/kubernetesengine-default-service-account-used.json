    "rationale": "Each GKE node has a Service Account associated with it. By default, nodes are given the Compute Engine default service account. This account has broad access by default, making it useful to wide variety of applications, but it has more permissions than are required to run your Kubernetes Engine cluster. You should create and use a minimally privileged service account to run your GKE cluster instead of using the Compute Engine default service account.",
