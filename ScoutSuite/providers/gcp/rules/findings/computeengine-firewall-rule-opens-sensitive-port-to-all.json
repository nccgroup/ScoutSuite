    "rationale": "The firewall rule was found to be exposing a well-known port to all source addresses. Well-known ports are commonly probed by automated scanning tools, and could be an indicator of sensitive services exposed to Internet. If such services need to be exposed, a restriction on the source address could help to reduce the attack surface of the infrastructure.",
