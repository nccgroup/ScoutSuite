    "description": "Uniform Bucket-Level Access Is Disabled",
    "rationale": "It is recommended to use uniform bucket-level access to unify and simplify how you grant access to your Cloud Storage resources. In order to support a uniform permissioning system, Cloud Storage has uniform bucket-level access. Using this feature disables ACLs for all Cloud Storage resources: access to Cloud Storage resources then is granted exclusively through Cloud IAM. Enabling uniform bucket-level access guarantees that if a Storage bucket is not publicly accessible, no object in the bucket is publicly accessible either.",
    "remediation": "From console:<ol><li>Open the Cloud Storage browser in the Google Cloud Console by visiting: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser</li><li>In the list of buckets, click on the name of the desired bucket.</li><li>Select the <samp>Permissions</samp> tab near the top of the page.</li><li>In the text box that starts with <samp>This bucket uses fine-grained access control</samp>..., click <samp>Edit</samp>.</li><li>In the pop-up menu that appears, select <samp>Uniform</samp>.</li><li>Click <samp>Save</samp>.</li></ol>",
