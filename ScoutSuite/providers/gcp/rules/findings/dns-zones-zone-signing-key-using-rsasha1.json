    "rationale": "The algorithm used for key signing should be a recommended one and it should be strong. When enabling DNSSEC for a managed zone, or creating a managed zone with DNSSEC, the user can select the DNSSEC signing algorithms and the denial-of-existence type. Changing the DNSSEC settings is only effective for a managed zone if DNSSEC is not already enabled. If there is a need to change the settings for a managed zone where it has been enabled, turn DNSSEC off and then re-enable it with different settings.",
    "remediation": "From Console:<ol><li>If it is necessary to change the settings for a managed zone where it has been enabled, NSSEC must be turned off and re-enabled with different settings. To turn off DNSSEC, run the following command:<br><code>gcloud dns managed-zones update ZONE_NAME --dnssec-state off</code></br></li><li>To update key-signing for a reported managed DNS Zone, run the following command:<br><code> gcloud dns managed-zones update ZONE_NAME --dnssec-state on --ksk-algorithm KSK_ALGORITHM --ksk-key-length KSK_KEY_LENGTH --zsk-algorithm ZSK_ALGORITHM --zsk-key-length ZSK_KEY_LENGTH --denial-of-existence DENIAL_OF_EXISTENCE</code></br></li></ol>",
