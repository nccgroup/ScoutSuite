    "rationale": "Separation of duties is the concept of ensuring that one individual does not have all necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action. In Cloud IAM-service accounts, this could be an action such as using a service account to access resources that user should not normally have access to. No user should have Service Account Admin and Service Account User roles assigned at the same time.",
