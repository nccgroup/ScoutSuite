Best practice recommends using GCP-managed keys, which are used by Cloud Platform services such as App Engine and Compute Engine. These keys cannot be downloaded. Google will keep the keys and automatically rotate them on an approximately weekly basis.<br><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundations v1.0.0 1.3</li></ul>",
