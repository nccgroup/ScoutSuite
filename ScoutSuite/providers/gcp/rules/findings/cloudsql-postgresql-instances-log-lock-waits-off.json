    "description": "Log Lock Waits Database Flag for PostgreSQL Instance Is off",
    "rationale": "The deadlock timeout defines the time to wait on a lock before checking for any conditions. Frequent run overs on deadlock timeout can be an indication of an underlying issue. Logging such waits on locks by enabling the log_lock_waits flag can be used to identify poor performance due to locking delays or if a specially-crafted SQL is attempting to starve resources through holding locks for excessive amounts of time. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.",
    "remediation": "From console:<ol><li>Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances.</li><li>Select the PostgreSQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled.</li><li>Click <samp>Edit</samp></li><li>Scroll down to the <samp>Flags</samp> section.</li><li>To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click <samp>Add item</samp>, choose the flag <samp>log_lock_waits</samp> from the drop-down menu, and set its value to <samp>off</samp>.</li><li>Click <samp>Save</samp></li><li>Confirm the changes under <samp>Flags</samp> on the Overview page.</li></ol>",
