    "description": "Lack of User-Managed Service Account Key Rotation",
    "rationale": "Rotating Service Account keys will reduce the window of opportunity for an access key that is associated with a compromised or terminated account to be used. User-managed Service Account keys should be rotated to ensure that data cannot be accessed with an old key which might have been lost, cracked, or stolen. It should be ensured that keys are rotated every 90 days.<br>This issue does not apply to system-managed keys, as they are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for signing for a maximum of two weeks. The rotation process is probabilistic, and usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the key's lifetime.",
