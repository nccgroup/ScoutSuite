  "description": "Legacy Network should be removed",
  "rationale": "Legacy networks have a single network IPv4 prefix range and a single gateway IP address for the whole network. The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions. Subnetworks cannot be created in a legacy network and are unable to switch from legacy to auto or custom subnet networks. Legacy networks can have an impact for high network traffic projects and are subject to a single point of contention or failure.",
  "remediation": "For each Google Cloud Platform project,<ol><li>1. Follow the documentation and create a non-legacy network suitable for the organization's requirements.</li><li>Follow the documentation and delete the networks in the <samp>legacy</samp> mode.</li></ol>",
