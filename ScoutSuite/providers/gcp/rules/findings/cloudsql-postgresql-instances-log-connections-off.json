    "description": "Log Connections Database Flag for PostgreSQL Instance Is off",
    "rationale": "PostgreSQL does not log attempted connections by default. Enabling the log_connections setting will create log entries for each attempted connection as well as successful completion of client authentication which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and to determine any unusual connection attempts to the server. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.",
    "remediation": "From console:<ol><li>Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances.</li><li>Select the PostgreSQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled.</li><li>Click <samp>Edit</samp></li><li>Scroll down to the <samp>Flags</samp> section.</li><li>To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click <samp>Add item</samp>, choose the flag <samp>log_connections</samp> from the drop-down menu, and set its value to <samp>off</samp>.</li><li>Click <samp>Save</samp></li><li>Confirm the changes under <samp>Flags</samp> on the Overview page.</li></ol>",
