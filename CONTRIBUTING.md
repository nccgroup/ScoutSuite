    * If it's a bug fix: `bugfix/issuenumber-descriptive-name` 
    * If it's a hot fix: `hotfix/issuenumber-descriptive-name` 
4. Implement your solution and the associated tests
5. Make sure your code follows the [PEP8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

 1. What version of Python are you using?
 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
 3. What did you do?
 4. What did you expect to see?
 5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a new feature

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Scout Suite, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Scout Suite has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process

Pull requests are regularly reviewed by the core team. We require a minimum of two reviewers before allowing to merge.
